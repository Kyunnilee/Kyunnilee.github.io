Hi! I am Heekyung(Anne) Lee. I am an Undergraduate Student in Computer Science at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/), South Korea. I am also an undergraduate researcher at [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), fortunate to be supervised under [Prof. Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/)'s group.

I am interested in studying <b>Vision</b> and <b>Language</b>. My current research focuses on applications of <b>vision-language models</b>, such as image captioning, visual question answering, and multimodal reasoning.

My recent research interests are on <b>Multi-Modal Language Models</b>. 
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hallucination in Vision Language Models</strong><br>
    ∘ What is <i>hallucination</i> in Vision Language Models, and what are effective training recipes to mitigate it? How can we address hallucinations caused by misalignment between image patches and text tokens?
  </li>
  <li><strong>Real-World Evaluation of Vision Language Models</strong><br>
      ∘ What is the gap between the performance of VLMs on benchmark datasets and in real-world tasks? How do Vision Language Models respond to complex tasks, and how should we analyze their responses to guide further improvements?
  </li>
</ul>
