Welcome to my simulation journal! ðŸ§€

Today, I spent time tweaking parameters for a cheese melting simulation using particle physics and surface reconstruction. It was surprisingly mesmerizing to watch a cube of cheese collapse under heat.

Here's a snapshot from the latest run:

Key updates from this run:

- Switched from uniform to Gaussian heat distribution
- Reduced spring stiffness to enhance melting realism
- Added surfel shading to better capture surface light scattering

Next up: exporting the animation into a Blender-friendly format!

Stay tuned for more visual cheese adventures ðŸ§ˆ
